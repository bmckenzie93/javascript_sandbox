Traversey Media: Udemy Course | Javascript Sandbox


# 1/10/20 Monday (4:30pm - 9:00pm) {
  Today I started the traversey media javascript udemy course. It is great so far, I have gone over all of the basic stuff so far like loops, functions, conditionals, arrays, objects, and the window object. I have been able to cement in knowledge that I held loosly before today. So far so good, I am excited to continue tomorrow.
