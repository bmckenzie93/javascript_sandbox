Traversey Media: Udemy Course | Javascript Sandbox


# 1/10/20 Monday (4:30pm - 9:00pm) {
  Today I started the traversey media javascript udemy course. It is great so far, I have gone over all of the basic stuff so far like loops, functions, conditionals, arrays, objects, and the window object. I have been able to cement in knowledge that I held loosly before today. So far so good, I am excited to continue tomorrow.

  The internet went out at 8:30pm due to the show lol. I went through traversing the dom, creating and adding elements, and events so far today. I feel like i'm understanding functions a lot more now that I have seen them be used over and over in differant situations, its just a part of the syntax. Im excited to move forward with this course and then add my new skills into my portfolio projects that I am creating. It feels good to be back to coding!
