Traversey Media: Udemy Course | Javascript Sandbox


# 1/10/20 Friday (4:30pm - 9:00pm) {
  Today I started the traversey media javascript udemy course. It is great so far, I have gone over all of the basic stuff so far like loops, functions, conditionals, arrays, objects, and the window object. I have been able to cement in knowledge that I held loosly before today. So far so good, I am excited to continue tomorrow.

  The internet went out at 8:30pm due to the show lol. I went through traversing the dom, creating and adding elements, and events so far today. I feel like i'm understanding functions a lot more now that I have seen them be used over and over in differant situations, its just a part of the syntax. Im excited to move forward with this course and then add my new skills into my portfolio projects that I am creating. It feels good to be back to coding!

  Today we are snowed into our property. I coulndt even get my van up the driveway when I got home yesterday. I shoveled my way in. This morning i climbed up to the roof with a ladder and a metal pole to knock the snow off of the satalite that gives me internet so I can study today. CHEERS!

  Damn so my life just completely exploded last time I sat down to code. A fight broke out in my home and my girlfriend ended up moving out.. I have to learn javascript and get a job so badly, nothing will stop me.
